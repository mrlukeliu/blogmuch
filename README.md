Following a code along by Brad Schiff on Udemy: "Learn JavaScript: Full-Stack from Scratch"

A Full-stack web app using JavaScript with Node and Express framework, EJS, socket.io, etc. to allow users to make posts, perform live searches, and message. This app uses MongoDB
to store and access user data. 

I did the back-end and some front-end JavaScript/EJS. The HTML and CSS were copy pasted templates.

Update plans: Add user ability to change username, add search by username
